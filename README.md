# üí´ About Me:
I am a dedicated software engineer with over a year of experience at the International Labour Association, where I honed my skills in developing impactful and user-centric applications. In addition, I have successfully developed various side project applications using Flutter and Dart, incorporating many packages like Firebase, Bloc, Provider, SQLite, Dio, HTTP, Rive and etc. Beyond my technical skills, I have actively participated in over 10 volunteering programs across Europe, which have significantly enhanced my ability to work effectively in cross-cultural teams.
